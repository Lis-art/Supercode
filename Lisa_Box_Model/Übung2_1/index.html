    <h1>Look, last night was a mistake.</h1>
    <p>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! It's toe-tappingly tragic! It's toe-tappingly tragic! Quite
        possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down
        with your children, and hitting them?</p>
    <p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. And then the battle's not so bad? You guys go on without me!
        <strong> I'm going to goâ€¦ look for more stuff to steal!</strong> <em> It's okay, Bender.</em> I like cooking
        too.</p>
    <h2>Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</h2>
    <p>Tell her she looks thin. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be
        something you'd have to freebase. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were
        there, and you were there!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bender, quit destroying the universe!</li>
        <li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li>
        <li>Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig".</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Say what?</h3>
